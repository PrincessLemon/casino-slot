What I built and how far I got

I created a slot machine web app called “Lofi Slot” using React + Vite. The app contains:

* 3 reels with 12 symbols each.
* A Spin button that animates the reels and stops them one by one.
* Win logic that checks for 2 or 3 matching symbols on a line.
* Credits + Bet system (optional feature).
* Extra win lines toggle (optional feature): when enabled, the game checks top + center + bottom lines and the spin costs more (cost = bet × number of lines).
* Sound effects + background music (optional eye candy, cuz we all love that little extra spark :D): spin SFX, win SFX, and looping background music with volume controls.
* A lofi background image (background.jpg) and a styled UI layout similar to the project example.

Status: The game is playable end-to-end (spin → stop → evaluate win → update credits), with UI, audio, and optional mechanics implemented.

Tools used + progression / issues

Development tools:

* Visual Studio Code (obviouslyyy)
* Node.js + npm
* Vite (React template)
* Chrome/Edge DevTools for debugging UI + console messages, and checking how it would look with different screens
* Git + GitHub (private repo) for source control

Progression:

* Generated a React project using Vite.
* Implemented reels and symbol lists (12 symbols).
* Added spin logic (timers/intervals) to simulate reels rolling and stopping.
* Added win evaluation and payout rules.
* Added credits/bet and adjusted the win logic to use the bet.
* Added optional extra win lines and changed cost per spin accordingly.
* Integrated audio (SFX + looping music) and added volume controls.
* Styled the UI to match the example and added the lofi background image.

Issues / what I got stuck on:

* npm package name error initially because the folder/project name contained spaces/uppercase. Fixed by using a valid npm package name (e.g. casino-slot).
* Browser autoplay restriction: background music may not start until after a user interaction. Solved by using a Music toggle button (user-initiated playback).
* UI “bouncy/flimsy” feeling during spin due to CSS animations. Solved by removing movement-based animations and using glow-only effects.
